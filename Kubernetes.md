# **Kubernetes Overview**
Kubernetes is a container orchestrator, which is to say it takes several containers (pods)on hosts (nodes) and make them logically act as one server. It does this by deciding how to spread the workload between the nodes.

It usually runs on top of docker and uses a set of APIs and CLI tools to manage the containers. It is also provided as a service by several cloud providers.

Uses `kubectl` (Cube-Control)
